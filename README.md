Organizations must prioritize the security and integrity of their user data with the ever-increasing risks associated with identity theft and unauthorized access.
To address these challenges, we developed the Identity Management Project  that focuses on efficient user registration, verification, and password management.

1. User Registration
   The User Registration function provides a secure onboarding experience for new users.
   By integrating this functionality into your application, you can enable users easily to create their accounts.
   Our registration process ensures that only valid and authentic users gain access to your system, thereby minimizing the risk of fake or fraudulent registrations.


2. User Verification
   The User Verification function plays a crucial role in confirming the identity and authenticity of registered users. It uses SMS verification method to ensure that only legitimate users gain access to the system. By implementing this functionality, you can maintain the integrity of your user base and enhance the overall security of your application.

3. Password Management
   Password security is a concern for both individuals and organizations.
   The Password Management function addresses this concern by providing users with the ability to set strong, unique passcodes for their accounts.
   Additionally, our system uses industry-standard encryption techniques to safeguard these passwords, ensuring protected from unauthorized access.
   By implementing this functionality, you can build trust with your users, as they will have peace of mind knowing their accounts are well-protected.
